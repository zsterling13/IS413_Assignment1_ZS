    <h3>What I hope to get out of IS 413</h3>
    <p>
        So far IS 413 has copied a lot of content from IS 403, mainly the overall structure of a professional website.
        I hope to learn more about incorporating features that make a website feel professional and usable: interactiveness,
        strong back-end support to store and process data, and further advice on how to successfuly structure a functioning website.
        There is a lot I have not learned about web development, so I am excited to learn a lot from this class.
        I understand that the course will be challenging, but I hope that it is not exceedingly daunting, meaning what is expected
        from students it attainable with a bit of stretching present. Although I hope to gain great skills in web development from this class
        I also understand that the point of a class is to not only teach content but to also excite students about the subject. I would
        like to be more excited about web development and participating in the magic that is the Internet.
